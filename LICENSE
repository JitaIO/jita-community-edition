## JITA Community Edition
JITA Community is a fully featured, best-in-class graph database that uses the GPL v3 license. We chose GPL because it means that JITA Community Edition can be used for free with your project: whether in the cloud or behind the firewall. If you’re building an application that accesses a JITA database running inside your organization (or on any personal device), then you are free to use Community Edition, whether or not your software is closed source.
